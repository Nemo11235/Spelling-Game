Abstract
This project was important for our group as it taught us deeply about Java. During the first meeting we got together and brainstormed many ideas for the project. We finally decided to settle on the spelling game. We started working on the game and writing the code.
We divided ourselves to different parts of the code. Zhexian worked on the GameFrame.Java and the GUI design. Jose and Moksh worked on the Player.Java, TextReader.Java and TextWriter.Java classes. Nicholas worked on the audio for the whoe game.
Ob jective
The objective of this project was to create a friendly and educational game for the kids as well as learn important techniques to use in the Java environment.
